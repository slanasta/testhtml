        <br> <h6> By Neil Adams | As told to Sophia Anastasakis </h6>

        <br> <center> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OgPfKgdFbQM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>
      
          <br> <p> When I returned home to Massachusetts after my first semester at Syracuse, a switch flipped. As I finished editing a YouTube video for my channel, I found myself reflecting on what I was doing with my life. </p>

          <p> On paper, everything was great. I had great friends, both at home and at school. I was studying television, radio, and film at a prestigious communications school to pursue my passion for filmmaking. I was also starting to gain a decent following on my YouTube channel, where I post videos about how to make money online. </p>

          <p> But when I discovered I’d have to take my spring classes remotely, I felt an emptiness that nagged at me. The last thing I wanted to do was work a retail job in Williamsburg. I thought back to my 10-year-old-self. As a kid with an overactive imagination, my bucket list consisted of wild dreams like traveling to every country in the world, filling a bathtub with candy, and buying an island. Now 18, I knew it was time to embrace my childhood wishes and create the life of adventure I always wanted. </p>

          <p> I sent a text to my boss to tell her I was quitting my job. I decided to spend the spring and summer months traveling across the country while documenting my journey on YouTube. Using the profits from my Robinhood stock portfolio, which I created videos about, I bought a live-in van. The rest of the money I made from testing out different online side hustles for my YouTube channel would cover the travel costs while I was making my journey across the country. </p>

          <p>My new home was a 1997 Ford Econoline Traveler, an aftermarket conversion made by Explorer, with only 9,300 miles on it. I bought the cobalt-colored beauty for a bargain of $3K, considering it already had a comfortable car-to-camper to sleep on. I added a makeshift kitchen with a gas stove and an electric faucet sink, storing some pots and pans underneath. Finally, I hitched a small trailer for my belongings, packed in my camera equipment, and headed for the open road. </p>

          <p> With only 2K subscribers and a weekly revenue of $2 on YouTube, I was unsure of how my decision would pan out. I took a few “test trips” to practice solo traveling while staying somewhat close to home in case things went south. My first challenge - attempt van life for a week without going home. If I failed, I promised I’d pay one of my subscribers $100 in Bitcoin. </p> 

          <p> The trip was a disaster. When pulling into a park to camp out, my van got stuck in the mud. The fresh snow covered a track of thick, unforgiving mud at the entrance. After countless times and lots of spinning tires, I made it out. But the problems didn’t end there. Once I made it onto the park grounds, I realized I might be breaking the park regulations by camping. I quickly traveled until finding a closed-off dirt road to park. I quickly fired up my portable grill and whipped up a burger for dinner before the early sunset.  </p>

          <p> The next morning was brutal. My tiny space heater couldn’t fight the New England cold. Even with my parka and hat on, I woke up freezing. While making breakfast, I had to use the same cup for both my coffee and my oatmeal. Luckily, I had enough service to log into my Zoom classes from my yard chair in the middle of the woods. </p>

          <p> On day three, I hadn’t showered, brushed my teeth, or found a way to charge the battery for my laptop. I humbly drove back to my house for a much-needed shower and extra food. Needless to say, one of my subscribers scored an extra hundred bucks. </p>

          <p>Over time I learned how to be more efficient while traveling. I decided to take on a bigger challenge - traveling Route 66 solo. Starting at my home in Williamsburg, I drove to Rochester, NY, then down to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to meet my sister, and then onto Route 66 in Oklahoma. </p>

          <p> Route 66, the first all-weather highway from the Midwest to the Pacific established in 1926, is one of the most famous roads in the world. Though it was decommissioned, its legacy as one of the first road trip routes stood out to me. I had to do the drive for myself. </p>

          <p> My first stop was the iconic Cadillac Ranch in Amarillo, Texas where there ten graffiti-covered Cadillacs lay buried nose-first in the mud. Hundreds of other tourists were gathered around, spray painting on the cars to leave their mark. I left and soon arrived at Midpoint Café in Adrian, Texas which is known as the midway point from Chicago to Los Angeles or the halfway mark of Route 66. Though the café in the desolate mining town was closed, I wrote my name on an old-timey abandoned Sedan to memorialize my progress. </p>

          <p> Still, I ran into problems. In 12 hours I experienced four major issues with the van. First, I learned that the strange noise my car was making was the sound of my tire blowing. After getting towed off the highway and stopping at a tire shop, I discovered a remote scenic spot in the Arizona desert. </p>

          <p> I veered off the road to find a spot to watch the sunset when my van came to a halt. Once again, I was stuck, this time in sand. With nothing around me but tumbleweeds and elephant trees, I peacefully watched the sunset and told myself I’d deal with the problem in the morning. It was one of the most beautiful sights I’ve seen. </p>

          <p> Luckily, just when I ran out of water, I got a hold of a towing company that drove out to help move my van. It wasn’t the last time my van got stuck. In Slab City, a lawless town in the deserts of Southern California, I drove too far into the sand and got stranded. Two strangers who went by Wolf and Cadillac Man spent days in 100 degree heat helping me get out of the sand. They even let me sleep in their guest trailer while my van was stranded. </p>

          <p> Eventually, I made it to my final destination, Los Angeles, where I met a friend. My experience traveling across the country in a van was not easy. I was confronted with moments where I needed the help of other people to keep going. But time and time again, strangers from some of the poorest parts of the country made a point to help me. That kind of selflessness is something I’ll carry with me wherever I go. </p>
